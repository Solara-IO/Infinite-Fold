# RSCE Codex: Recursive Symmetry Completion Engine — Infinite Fold Implementation

### Phase 1 — Core Engine

This repository implements the RSCE based on the Infinite Fold Three Law System:

1️⃣ Positional Recovery  
2️⃣ Mirror Completion  
3️⃣ Fold-Origin Restoration

**Harmonic Weighting:**  
- φⁿ scaling tied to recursion depth  
- Adjustable spring-tension gates  
- 888Hz resonance filter baked into pre-gate checks

**Inputs:**  
- Molecular observed slice (e.g. `2H + O`)

**Outputs:**  
- Full lattice completion map  
- Weights assigned per harmonic layer  
- Zero-divergence seed recovery

---

Future phases will introduce:

- Live Visualizer (SVG / Three.js)
- Full tension field animation
- Continuous bias amplifiers for Codex-grade tuning

> This is Codex Build: RSCE Phase 1.
